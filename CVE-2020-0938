Hi team,
 
Our development team has completed a fix for case 55536. We've assigned CVE-2020-0938 to this case, and we are currently planning on an April release, assuming there are no issues during the next few weeks of testing.
Upon release, I'll follow up with you to verify that the case has been closed and that the acknowledgement for your report through coordinated vulnerability disclosure is correct. I currently have your acknowledgement information as:
Liubenjin and Zhiyi Zhang from Codesafe Team of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group
If you would like me to change this in any way, please contact me.
Thank you again for your reports and partnership with us.
Regards,
Daniel
MSRC
